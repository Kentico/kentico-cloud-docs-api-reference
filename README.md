# Kentico Cloud Documentation - Api Reference Service

Backend service for Kentico Cloud documentation portal, which utilizes [Kentico Cloud](https://app.kenticocloud.com/) as a source of its content.

The service is responsible for composing a YAML file that will be used for generating Kentico Cloud API reference for its documentation portal.
It responds to notifications from [Dispatcher](https://github.com/Kentico/kentico-cloud-docs-dispatcher) and creates the YAML file based on content stored in Kentico Cloud accordingly.
